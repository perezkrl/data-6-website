Hi, I'm Karol (she/her)! I am passionate about the medical field, history, building/carpentry, and social justice. I wish to explore opportunities to further my knowledge and experience in the medical field as a Biology major at college.

I am a rising freshman at UC Berkeley. Other than academics, I am interested in baking! I enjoy trying new recipes and tasting them. My other hobbies include reading, swimming, and chess.
